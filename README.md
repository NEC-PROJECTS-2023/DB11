### Introduction
Phishing is a social engineering attack that aims at exploiting the weakness found in the system at the user’s end. For example, a system may be technically secure enough for password theft but the unaware user may leak his/her password when the attacker sends a false update password request through forged (phished) website. For addressing this issue, a layer of protection must be added on the user side to address this problem.
A phishing attack is when a criminal sends an email or the url pretending to be someone or something he’s not, in order to get sensitive information out of the victim. The victim in regard to his/her curiosity or a sense of urgency, they enter the details, like a username, password, or credit card number, they are likely toacquiesce. The recent example of a Gmail phishing scam that targeted around1billion Gmail users worldwide.
